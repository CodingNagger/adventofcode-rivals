# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. I tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help me do more.

## Getting started

### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

- Fork this repo.

And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! You're change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **master**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

### Tests

We've written tests and you can run them to assure the stability of the code, just try `npm test` after running at least once `npm install`. If you're adding a new functionality please write a test for it.

### Documentation

If you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented. Code and method names should be self-explanatory.
